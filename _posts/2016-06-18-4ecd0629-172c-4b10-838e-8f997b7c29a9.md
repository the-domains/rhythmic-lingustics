Sprinting to the Sun

  
At all the choices,I take a look back 

To all the roads with my backpack 

To what I have seen 

To what I have been 

  
You go it alone 

You leave it on your own 

Then you think of all the people you're not speaking to

There are things you should do. 

  
I need to connect with my pack

I need to revise my plan of attack 

Your goals, your dreams are you

Your friends are there to share the view 

  
Screaming on the rooftops 

Partying to every bass drop

Laughing on the dock 

Rolling Stones to the rock 

  
Sprinting to the sun

Enjoy it with everyone 

Your burdens are gone

So you can love the wins you won 

  
Waking up to the sun

To the warm touch of someone

A reward for all that was done.

But I ain't no Saint so I must go on the run.

  
Sprinting to the sun

Running under the gun

Before it sinks you like a ton

Until you realise it's had its run

  
But until that enjoy the fun

Yourself you are one

To find your joy with everyone 

And then find peace with the setting sun.

  
From the rise to the fall

From spring to the fall

All the times loving it all
